#Random Matching
======

Utilizing Socket.io, NodeJS, Express, Mongoose/MongoJS and React - this simple project allows users to quickly create a profile with a name and image and join a chat room.

The point of this is to show how to randomly join open rooms or create one if none is available. 

This is showing chat, but can be applied to random matching for games or anything else you would need to have a random person matched to.

Currently adding Tic Tac Toe to the mix.
